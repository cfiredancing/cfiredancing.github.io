title: About Me

---

My name is Calen Firedancing. I am:

* a poet and writer
* a Black queer feminist
* Williams English '20
* from Phoenix, Arizona via Los Angeles

Unfortunately, I have no experience with programming or textiles. In a world where computers could not be more important, Computer Science 103 Electronic Textiles is a perfect class for an artist like me to gain necessary experience while still tapping into the creative power that makes programming and poetry kin fields of thought.
