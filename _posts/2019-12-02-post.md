# Gender Reveal Pillow  
The Gender Reveal Pillow is a light performance piece that makes fun of the cultural practice of gender reveals by pretending (and then failing to) detect gender on a pregnant stomach. When one side of the pillow is placed on a stomach (blocking the light sensor), and the switch on the Black Trans flag is ON, the Jaws theme plays while random colors flash on the RGB light (signaling that the detector is processing). Suddenly, the buzzer stops the song and begins beeping while red lights flash (the RGB and two LEDs) to signal an error.

I wanted to make something that was performative instead of useful. By using gender reveals as the subject of the performance, the inutility of the pillow becomes the joke itself.
